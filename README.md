# Executer 2
This is a new approach to the executer bot, including basically all the features from before in a more organised fashion
and using an online database for certain applications.

## Requirements
To run the bot, you need Python 3.7 or newer with the following modules:
 - discord      (1.0.1)
 - mongodb      (3.9.0)
